I am a passionate developer interested in many aspects of computer science and related disciplines. 
I started programming when I was 14 and never stopped since then. 
I learned and forgot many languages: Pascal, Delphi, Visual Basic, C/C++, Java, Fortran and more. 
My current language of choice is Python but I am deepening my knowledge of Go.

On a theoretical level I am interested in modeling been it mathematical, statistical or algorithmic. 
Lately I have realized more and more that computer programming should be seen a modeling act.
We take the requirements of a client and we architect it into a computer program that 
matches as much as the requirements as possible.

Following these realization I started reading more and more about [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) 
as it seams to me one of the few areas of software design that really focuses on modeling as the central language 
used to describe what it tries to achieve.
